# Chip 8 emulator in Javascript

The Chip 8 computer is a simple but popularized computer and CPU architecture. This is the source code for an implementation written in Javascript.

## Running locally

Start by cloning the Git repository. Then in the root directory, simply start a web server. I prefer to use a VSCode extension called Live Server to run and debug.
